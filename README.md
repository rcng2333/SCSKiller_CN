  <strong>Shader Compilation Stutter Killer.</strong> SCSKiller compiles your games' shaders into your GPU driver's
  cache before you play, so the game doesn't stop to compile them mid-game. Free and open source, for Windows.

## Why

When a game meets a new effect, your GPU driver has to compile its shader right then, and the frame waits for it.
That's the hitch you feel as shader compilation stutter.

SCSKiller reads the shaders a game ships with, works out the pipelines it will build, and compiles them into your
driver's shader cache ahead of time, from its own process and with the game closed. When you launch the game, they're
already there.

## Results

About 5 minutes of play per game, cold driver cache → compiled with SCSKiller. A stutter is a shader compile the game had to wait 20 ms or more for.

Measured with SCSKiller's pipeline recorder. Your numbers will vary by game, GPU and driver.

- **Fixes:** shader compilation stutter.
- **Can't fix:** traversal and streaming stutter, or hitches with other causes.
- **Now and then:** a shader it couldn't find or record can still compile in game.

## Features

- **NVIDIA and AMD.** DirectX 12 games, and DirectX 11 games on NVIDIA.
- **Finds your games** in Steam, Epic Games, EA app, GOG, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox (PC), Battle.net, PURPLE, HoYoPlay and Gaijin.
- **Knows which games stutter:** the library puts known offenders on top, with the reason.
- **Recompiles after driver updates.** A driver update clears the shader cache; SCSKiller notices and compiles again,
  on its own if you let it.
- **Optional recorder** for games whose pipelines can't be worked out from their files: play a few minutes with it on,
  then compile. It can also record alongside a mod that replaces shaders.
- **Frame times per session.** With the recorder on, a game's page graphs your last session and tells the shader
  stutters apart from other hitches. Frame times stay on your PC.
- **Play button** in the Library and on a game's page: starts the game through its store.
- **Community shader hash database** for Patreon supporters: other players' recordings, so your games are covered
  without recording them first. Sharing your own is opt-in and anonymous: shader hashes only.
- **Never touches anti-cheat games** beyond reading their files: no launching, no injecting, no recorder. The one
  exception is opt-in, per game and confirmed every time: an offline session without EasyAntiCheat for ELDEN RING and
  ARMORED CORE VI, at your own risk.

## Install

| Requirement | |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 (version 2004) or 11, 64-bit |
| GPU | NVIDIA or AMD |
| Games | DirectX 12; DirectX 11 on NVIDIA |

Intel GPUs aren't supported yet: I don't have one to test on. If you'd like to sponsor an Intel Arc GPU, get in touch at
[contact@scskiller.com](mailto:contact@scskiller.com).

Download `SCSKiller-Setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/BlueHeisenberg/SCSKiller/releases/latest)
and run it. It installs for your user only, needs no admin rights, and keeps itself up to date.

Or take `SCSKiller-<version>-Portable.zip`, unzip it to any folder you can write to and run `SCSKiller.exe`: it updates
itself the same way. Before deleting a portable folder, turn recording off for your games, so the recorder leaves the
game folders.

## How to use it

1. **Open SCSKiller.** It finds your games and the shaders they ship with.
2. **Queue games and press Compile.** "Add all recommended" is a good start. Keep the game closed while it compiles.
3. **Play**, from your store or with the game's Play button, which starts it through its store. You can close
   SCSKiller: the game reads the driver's cache on its own. Or leave it open while you play:
   it then checks that the compile reached the cache the game really uses, and with the recorder on, the game's page
   shows afterwards the frame times of your session and whether anything still compiled during it.

If a game says it needs a recording, turn on **Record**, play it for a few minutes, then compile it.

## FAQ

**Is it safe with anti-cheat games?** SCSKiller never launches them, injects into them or gives them the recorder. It
only reads their files. The one exception is an offline session, for games that run offline without EasyAntiCheat when
their exe is started directly (ELDEN RING, ARMORED CORE VI): allowed per game on its page, confirmed before every launch,
and at your own risk. SCSKiller adds `d3d12.dll`, `scskiller.ini`, `scskiller.armed` and `steam_appid.txt` to the game's
folder, starts the game's exe itself (offline, no EasyAntiCheat), and the recorder records only that process: started any
other way, through Steam with EasyAntiCheat too, it records nothing. Steam must be running (offline mode is fine). The
moment the game exits, SCSKiller takes those files out again, keeps the recording and the session's frame times, and
checks the folder is as it was, also when SCSKiller itself was closed meanwhile; after a crash or power loss it does so
at the next logon or start. If its files are still there when you start the game online, you could be banned.

**What does it write, and where?** Its settings and per-game plans go in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SCSKiller\`, and the compiled
pipelines go in your driver's own shader cache. Game files are never modified. The one exception is the optional
recorder: it adds `d3d12.dll`, `scskiller.ini` and `scskiller.armed` to the folder of the game you turn it on for, and
turning it off removes exactly those files. `scskiller.armed` says the game's install was checked for anti-cheat; SCSKiller
deletes it as soon as anything in the install changes. The recorder decides when the game starts: it records that session
only if the file is there then, and a session already running keeps recording until the game exits. Uninstalling SCSKiller
removes these files, and the recording it wrote there, from every game folder.

**Does it touch my drivers or their settings?** No. It compiles through DirectX, the way the game would.

**Do I need an account?** No. Everything the app does on your PC is free. Signing in with Patreon only adds the
supporter features.

**My game isn't detected, or something broke.** Open an [issue](https://github.com/BlueHeisenberg/SCSKiller/issues/new/choose)
with the bug or game request template.

keep the SCSKiller copyright notices. The measurements and screenshots in this README are SCSKiller's own, so please

Official builds come only from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/BlueHeisenberg/SCSKiller/releases) page.
A fork's builds, bugs and anti-cheat behaviour are its author's: SCSKiller keeps its recorder out of anti-cheat games,
and can't vouch for a fork that changes that.

Improvements are always welcome back here as pull requests. Fixes, games and ideas from forks make SCSKiller better
for everyone.
